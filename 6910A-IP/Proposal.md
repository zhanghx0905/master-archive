### Project

**Title**: AI Driving Behavior Analytics For Telematics Insurance Pricing

**Description**:

Glassbox AI Ltd is a tech startup transforming Decision Making across industries with transparent and compliance technology. Our mission is to make AI more reliable, transparent, and friendly with the development of Explainable AI, breaking the compliance barriers that current black box ML models fail to meet. We aim to develop scalable AI applicable in various highly-regulated industries, with the help of both consumer-facing apps and B2B collaborations. 

The student will facilitate one of our ongoing projects: IoT insurance powered by XAI. Our solution will allow the collection of more granular data on drivers’ behaviors in real-time and enable the delivery of more sophisticated insurance pricing plans for users. 2. Backend Engineer • Work on the POC system to make telematics data collection smoother and cloud architecture more efficient. • Ensure stable connection and optimize data flow in the shortest amount of time between the device and the cloud. • Assist existing backend engineers with routine maintenance and updates to the system. • Must be familiar with Raspberry Pi, Cloud Architecture, and Python.

### Scope and Workload

The student will work as a **machine learning engineer**. The work may include: 

- Research telematics data and driving behavior analysis.
- Work with raw time series data to optimize existing driving behavior prediction models.
- Debug and add new features in the model like video/image data.
- Assist existing ML engineers with data processing and other tasks.

The working hours are nine **hours per week**. Students will work directly with company staffs, and will also **meet with the supervisor once a month** to share progress.

### Grading

Scoring will be determined by the workload fulfillment, four meetings, and reports.
